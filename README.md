# rdu-c19
An interactive graphical visualization of CoVID concentration in wastewater
for the RTP area.

This project is a spiritual (but not a technical) fork of
[dball/triangle-covid](https://github.com/dball/triangle-covid);
the methodology and conclusions are (I think) essentially identical;
only the technology and presentation differ.

You can view [the visualization here](https://frosty-grass-5181.fly.dev/).
